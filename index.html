<h2>A Short Intro.</h2>
<p>I received the B.S. degree in Aerospace Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU, Rank 105th in US News 2022) in 2018. 
   And now, I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in SJTU under the supervision of Prof. Xingqun Zhan. My research interests include </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Navigation Integrity: integrity monitoring algorithms and constellation integrity perfomance evaluation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multi-Sensor Integration, e.g., GNSS/INS tight integration and GNSS/INS/Vision integration</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multi-Agent Cooperative Navigation: fusion architecture design, dynamic scheduling of fusion architecture, and integrity monitoring
<br /></p>
</li>  
The title of my Ph.D. thesis will be "Ensuring Navigation Integrity of Multi-Sensor Integration
   for Future Autonomous Systems", which is expected to be finished in December 2022. After I get the PhD degree, I plan to do a two- or three-year postdoctoral research in 
   a U.S. or E.U. university. I would appreciate it if you can offer/recommend a postdoc position to me! </p>
</ul>
<br /></p>
